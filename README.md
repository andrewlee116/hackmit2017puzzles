# hackmit2017puzzles
My solutions for part of the HACKMIT 2017 puzzles. I could only get up to problem 3 (out of 5) before the solutions were released, and then was able to implement problem 3 on my own. Unfortunately, I couldn't put my own implementations of puzzles 4 and 5 without feeling like I'm just copy and pasting other peoples' solutions. Since I'm not too knowledgable in ML or Neural Networks yet, I just appreciated the solutions writeup on the HACKMIT Medium post for now.
