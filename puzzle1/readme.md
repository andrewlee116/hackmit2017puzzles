# Step 1: Decipher
The home page of the first puzzle contained a bunch of unreadable text.
However, the text was ciphered using a simple Caesar cipher.
In this case, I think the text was shifted by 19 letters.
After doing so, the page then gives a link to a .jar file.

# Step 2: .jar file
I wasn't sure what to do with this file, so I just ran it on terminal.
The output: "It's not your time ;)"
Hmmmmmm...
After a few hours of being confused, I decompiled the .jar file and got a nice .java file.
By looking into the java code a little bit, I modified it so that it would pass the if statement and got the answer.
